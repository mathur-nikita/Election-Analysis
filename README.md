# Election Analysis

## Overview of Project

For this project we have been asked by Tom, a Colorado Board of Elections employee, to help with an audit of the election results of a U.S. Congressional Precinct in Colorado.  In order to complete this audit the following tasks must be completed:

1) Reporting the total number of votes cast
2) Collecting the complete list of candidates who received votes
3) Reporting the number of votes cast for each candidate
4) Reporting the percentage of votes each candidate received 
5) Reporting the winner of the election based on popular vote

This work is usually completed in Excel but we have been asked if the entire process can be automated using Python.  If the audit runs successfully then the same process can be reused to audit other elections (ex. congressional districts, senatorial districts, local elections).

## Resources 

 - Data Source: election_results.csv
 - Software: Python 3.6.1, Visual Studio Code 1.62.0
